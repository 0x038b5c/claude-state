## What I was doing
Integrating claude-setup, loader, and payload so the full chain works for any github_username

## What's done
- Audited all three repos end-to-end
- Confirmed .gitignore on claude-setup is already correct (no egg/pyc junk)
- Confirmed loader templates (mode A/B) already pass github_username to payload
- Wrote integration plan to claude-setup/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-13-loader-payload-integration.md
- Updated CLAUDE.md and .claude/todo.md in claude-setup

## What's in flight

## What's next
- Execute plan Step A: parameterize claude-payload/src/main.py (sys.argv[1], write /opt/github_username)
- Execute plan Step B: parameterize claude-payload/src/tool.py (read /opt/github_username)
- Execute plan Step C: add .gitignore to claude-payload
- Commit and push claude-payload
